**MINI QUIZ PROJECT**


The main goal of the project focused more on practicing event handling and creating forms in JavaScript using the React framework.

The project involves fetching open trivial API and displaying multiple-choice questions at a time. The user can select an answer and click submit to check if the answer is correct or incorrect. Conditional rendering was incorporated to let the user know if the selected answer was right or wrong.

By incorporating event-handling methods and map functions.
The project allows users to select the category and difficulty of questions to work on.

The project also involves using {useState} hook which is imported from react and helps maintain the state of created variables and functions.

Try and catchy mechanism was essential in helping the user know whether the API link was fetched successfully, or display a message if there was an error while fetching data.

The project allows users to interact with the application and helps users to move to the next question once finished with the current one.
