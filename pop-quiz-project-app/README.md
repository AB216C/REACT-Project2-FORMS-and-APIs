**POP QUIZ PROJECT**

*Event Handling, Forms, and Fetching API*


The main goal of the project focused more on practicing event handling and creating forms in JavaScript using the React framework.

The project involves fetching open trivial API and displaying one multiple-choice question at a time. The user can select an answer and click submit to check if the answer is correct or incorrect. Conditional rendering was incorporated to let the user know if the selected answer was right or wrong.

By incorporating event-handling methods and map functions, users are able to select the category and difficulty of questions they prefer to work on.

The project also involves using {useState} hook which is imported from react and helps to maintain the state of created variables and functions.

Try and catchy mechanism was essential in helping the user to know whether the API link was fetched successfully, and display a message in case there was an error while fetching data.

The project allows users to interact with the application and helps users to move to the next question once finished with the current one.
